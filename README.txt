Booktype
-------------------

A booktype is like a wiki, but instead of ending up with a web page you get a book.  
Booktype is built on top of the Django web framework.

This fork is for the fi.flossmanuals.net site. Just small tweaking, localization and a gloomy Finnish new look. Nothing to see here, move ahead!
